In recent years, the scarcely populated mid-Atlantic island has also become known to Game of Thrones superfans as the haunting place where scenes “beyond the Wall” are filmed.</p><p>But incomprehensible monikers and occasional international headlines aside, Iceland is a truly fascinating, wild, and otherworldly destination worth at least a week of exploration, easily accomplished as an extended layover when flying between the U.S. and Europe. Situated on the unsteady divide between the slowly drifting American and Eurasian tectonic plates, the former Viking stronghold has become a cosmopolitan country with a stylish capital city, Reykjavík, featuring friendly, English-speaking locals and an abundance of culture and dining. Still, there’s a penetrating feeling that nature will always prevail.</p><p>At some point, most people pick up the adage that Iceland is green, while neighboring Greenland is icy. However, Iceland is rather chilly much of the time. Temperatures average between 36 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit, and the weather is known to change in a split second, making quick-drying layers imperative. Additionally, there are only four to five hours of daylight during winter, while in the summer the sun sets for just a couple of hours per night.</p><p>As for its reputation as the land of fire and ice, that’s thanks to 30 active volcanoes (on an island about the size of Kentucky) alongside plenty of glaciers and icebergs. There are also tens of thousands of tiny horses: one petite, wild-maned Icelandic steed for every four people, to be exact.</p>",

There are several challenging and visually spectacular courses.\n\nThere are major plusses to visiting in the wintertime, the magical Northern Lights being the most significant. Of Aurora Borealis, lauded writer and poet W.H. Auden wrote in Letters From Iceland, “It was holy ground still, with the most magical light of anywhere on earth.” The spectacular neon show is best viewed between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m., though clouds can easily thwart those plans. At the Ion Hotel, guests soak in a heated outdoor pool while waiting for the fantastic display to light the sky; likewise at the Secret Lagoon natural hot springs in the Golden Circle.",

There, milky blue pools are naturally 98-104 degrees Fahrenheit year-round and full of silica, algae and minerals. (Tip: Coat your hair in plenty of the provided conditioner before and after soaking, as the spring water is extremely dehydrating.)\n\nIceland’s most famous waterfall is Gullfoss, or Golden Falls, into which pagan idols were tossed upon the country's conversion to Christianity some 1,000 years ago. At 160 feet, Europe’s most powerful waterfall is Dettifoss. The 70-foot spouting Geysir, after which all the world’s geysers are named, is also awe-inspiring.",

Stroll past Hallgrímskirkja, the country’s tallest and most dramatic church; catch a show in the impressive geometric steel-and-glass Harpa concert hall; and shop the design stores on Skólavörðustígur Street and Kolaportid Flea Market for everything from wool sweaters to fermented fish. Along the way, stop to admire the city's vibrant street-art scene, or refresh yourself in one of the many local coffeehouses.\n\nMuseums in Iceland are unique to say the least. Visit Eldfjallasafn for a vast collection of volcanic rocks from around the world and volcano-related art, including a fiery Andy Warhol lithograph depicting Mount Vesuvius. There’s also Húsavik Whale Museum, which holds massive suspended skeletons of various species.

Steam vents rise across the terrain. There is even a cafe beside a hot river that cooks food—bread, cakes, hard-boiled eggs—in the ground via natural heat.\n\nIn Reykjavík, KEX Hostel offers modern industrial accommodations with a hip gastropub, while excellent Danish cooking is found at Narfeyrarstofa. Two hours outside the city, Hotel Budir is a must-visit for its gorgeous glacier-side location and restaurant known for its dedication to the slow food movement and local ingredients.\n\nThe rumors are true: Icelandic cuisine does involve both horse meat and whale. But one also finds plentiful fresh seafood, lamb and hot dogs—one of the nation’s most popular foods! Additionally, there is a burgeoning craft beer scene, featuring local brews made with some of the purest Arctic water on earth.\n\nIt’s just further evidence of the way Iceland’s strange and beautiful environs creep into every aspect of the magical destination with adventure around every bend. As Stephen Markley wrote in Tales of Iceland, “The problem with driving around Iceland is that you’re basically confronted by a new soul-enriching, breath-taking, life-affirming natural sight every five goddamn minutes.
